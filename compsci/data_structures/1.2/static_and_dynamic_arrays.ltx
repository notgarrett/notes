\section*{\center{What is a static Array?}}
A static array is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n-1]. \\
Q: What is meant by being 'indexable'? \\
A: This means that each slot/index in the array can be referenced with a number.
\section*{\center{When and where is a static Array used?}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Storing and accesing sequential data
	\item Temporarily storing object
	\item Using by IO routines as buffers
	\item Lookup table and inverse lookup tables
	\item Can be used to return multiple values from a function
	\item Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems
\end{enumerate}

\section*{\center{Static Array}}
\[A =
  \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    44 & 12 & -5 & 17 & 6 \\
  \hline
    0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
  \hline
\end{array}
\]
Elements in A are referenced by their index. There is no other way to acces elements in an array. Array indexing is zero-based, meaning the first element is found in position zero. 
\section*{Operations on Dynamic Arrays}
\subsection*{Dynamic Array}
The dynamic array can grow and shrink in size. \\
A = [34, 4]\\ 
A.add(34) => A = [34, 4, 34] \\
Q: How can we implement a dynamic array? \\
A: One way is to use a static array!
{\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a static array with an initial capacity. 
  \item Add elements to the underlying static array, keeping track of the number of elements. 
  \item If adding another element will exceed the capacity, then create a new static array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements into it.
\end{enumerate}}

Suppose we create a dynamic array with an initial capacity of two and then mbegin adding elements to it. 
  
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  \empty & \empty \\
  \hline
\end{array}
=> 
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  7 & \empty \\
  \hline
\end{array}
=>
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  7 & -9 & 3 & \empty \\
  \hline
\end{array}
=> 
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  7 & -9 & 3 & 12 \\
  \hline
\end{array}
\]

Note the array will double when overflow occurs\dots
